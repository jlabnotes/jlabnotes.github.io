## Skills Level explanation
1. **_Expert_** - this is my main specialty, I have done it many times in many projects including architecture design, configuration, deployment and trainings.
2. **_Intermediate_** - this belongs to my specialty but it is either less often used or requires more time to study and there was no need to extend the knowledge about that particular app
3. **_Beginner_**	- this belongs to my specialty but there is yet much to be learnt and gain more experience. I created some of this configuration or used this functionality only on a few occasions or I am in the training process.
